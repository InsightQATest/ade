<a id="train" class="anchor" href="#train" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Generating a model of 'normal' behavior - <strong>train</strong></h1>


<p><strong>train</strong> is a bash script which invokes the correct Java class after setting up the 
environment needed. <strong>train</strong> creates a baseline of expected behavior against which
the Linux logs being processed by <strong>analyze</strong> are compared.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>Use <strong>train</strong> to create a model(baseline) that is 
used by  <strong>analyze</strong> to detect anomalies in Linux logs. <strong>train</strong> extracts the
information it needs from the JDBC compliant database which is populated 
by <strong>upload</strong> and  <strong>analyze</strong>.  The results are written to the file 
system when <strong>train</strong> completes and are
read from the file system by <strong>analyze</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Notes</p>

<ul>
<li>train will use all the information in the database to create a model unless either
a start date or a start date and end date are provided</li>
<li>not seen in model is based on the information processed during <strong>train</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Restrictions</h3>

<p>The quality of the model depends on the amount of information that is available to create
the model. <strong>analyze</strong> will mark certain analysis results as questionable
using information created by <strong>train</strong>. This happens when <strong>train</strong> is able to detect that the model 
will have problems differentiating between good and bad intervals. If 
<strong>verify</strong> indicated that there was insufficient data, <strong>train</strong> may not run successfully
and will likely not produce a model which has a lot of explanatory power.</p>
