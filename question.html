<p>Use the index.xml files for the Linux systems analyzed to answer the following questions:</p>
<ul><li>Which Linux system is the most likely culprit?</li>
<li>When is the first evidence of the problem?</li>
<li>Are any new messages being seen?</li>
<li>Are there any intervals without messages?</li>
</ul>
Use interval_nnn.xml &nbsp;for the system and time period of interest to answer the following questions:<br>
<ul><li>What messages are unusual?</li>
<li>How often did the unusual message get issued?</li>
<li>Are messages issued in context within an expected pattern?</li>
<li>When did the message ID first appear?</li>
<li>Did the message appear when expected?</li>
<li>Did the message occur at an expected predictable time (for example, every 81 seconds)?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Contents of interval_nnn.xml displayed using default xslt</h2>
ADE generates an xml file for each interval in the index.xml file.
&nbsp;The current defaults will create 144 files with nnn ranging
from 0 to 144. &nbsp;The interval_6.xml covers the time period
from&nbsp; 00:00 to 01:00. &nbsp;The relationship between
analysis interval and analysis snapshot is described in
